#Feature Selection for Diabetes Dataset

This project aims to evaluate the strength of features in the diabetes dataset, which is a regression problem consisting of 10 features used to predict the progression of diabetes. Multiple feature selection techniques are used, including Pearson correlation coefficient, mutual information, random forest feature importance, and recursive feature elimination.

For each technique, a bar graph is plotted to illustrate the importance of each feature, and the top 5 features are printed out. The project seeks to identify if there are any 3 features that are consistently selected in the top 5 by all 4 methods.

Additionally, the project explores how the dependence between features affects the feature selection methods.
