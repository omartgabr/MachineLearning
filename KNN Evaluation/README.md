# Evaluating a KNN Classifier Model with Train/Test Sets

This project utilizes the penguins dataset to perform K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification.

The focus of this project is to evaluate the KNN model using training and testing sets, to determine the optimal number of neighbors for classifying our target. The code in this repository includes the data preprocessing and visualization, as well as the implementation of the KNN model and evaluation of its performance.

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to properly evaluate a KNN model and the impact of varying the number of neighbors. Note that this project does not include the actual classification process, but rather the evaluation of the model.

Feel free to run the code and explore the results. Any feedback or questions are welcome.
