# MNIST Image Classification with Linear Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project that uses the full MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.

The project employs linear regression to create a binary classification model, and uses a binary classifier to evaluate the model's performance. The model trains and tests on each digit individually and plots the results against the other digits, storing the metrics in a triangular matrix.

The goal of this project is to accurately classify handwritten digits and provide a deeper understanding of linear regression in the context of image classification.
